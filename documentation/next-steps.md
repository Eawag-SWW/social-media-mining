Next Steps
==========

- Improving topic detection (e.g. classification of tweets in rain-related or not rain-related) 
  using machine learning and nlp 
- Mining road conditions during floods with social media. Follow-up: Recomputing emergency routes combining road 
  conditions with graph-based algorithms
- Finding regions where social media weather measurements could be significantly better than existing measurements
  (e.g. Africa)
- Detection of pipe burst with social media. Follow-up: Real-time warning system.
- Distinction rain/hail/snow
- Weather sentiment analysis: How satisfied are people with the weather (use unclear)
- How well can you measure weather in switzerland with social media?
- How satisfied are people with water supply/distribution (using sentiment analysis)
