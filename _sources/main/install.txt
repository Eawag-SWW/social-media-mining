Install
=======

This project used the Anaconda Python distribution with its package
manager conda for development. It is also possible to install it with
another distribution and pip, but using Anaconda and conda should be
easier and is the suggested way.

   ::

       conda env create -f .conda_requirements.yml

-  Activate this new environment with

   ::

       source activate social-media-mining

-  Clone the git repository with

   ::

       git clone https://github.com/eawag-sww/social-media-mining

-  Create a new file called ``local_config.py`` in folder ``main`` with
   the line

   ::

       ROOT_DIR = path to your root folder of the project

-  Add a file called ``secrets.py`` to folder ``main`` containing Flickr
   and Twitter API passwords:

   ::

       FLICKR_API_KEY = 
       FLICKR_API_SECRET = 
       TWITTER_CONSUMER_KEY =  
       TWITTER_CONSUMER_SECRET =
